##################################

Overview:
	Unfair Dice is a program that rolls a biased dice "n" number of times given the probabilities of landing on each face

Included files:
	- unfairDice.py
	- README
	- .gitignore -- ignore this

Instructions to run:
	- At the very bottom of the `unfairDice.py` file, under the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section, replace the `pass` keyword with either the `biased_roll` function or the `draw_histogram` function (information about these functions can be found using the `help()` function)
	- Save the `unfairDice.py` file, then run `$ python3 unfairDice.py` in the terminal to run the program.

Optional features:
	- Change the style of the histogram to softmax: Under the `draw_histogram` function, in line 77, feel free to change `occurances = max_norm(occurances)` to `occurances = softmax(occurances)`. Use the help function to discover more about `max_norm` and `softmax`. Note: this is not part of the assignment. Do not mark
